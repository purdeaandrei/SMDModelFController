            moved setpoint decoupler cap to hopefully lower interferance with
            relatively high frequency output from the comparitors
            
            connector positioning for plugboard complete
            
            moved sense connector to allow better placement of corresponding
            socket on plugboards (sense traces needed more room on plugboards)

            added ground strap points to plugboards, and positioned them to
            align with the ground strap on the main board
            
            displaywriter plugboard completely wired
            
            added cutouts in plugboards for expasion header wiring
        todo:
            maybe add more grounding straps to aid in mechanical strength
            (i intend to use metal standoffs to connect the plugboards and 
            main board)

            fine tune the castelations
            add cutouts for throughhole components to pigybacking plugboards

            Updated Pro Micro schematic symbol (fixed incorrect pin names, and made pin names more verbose)
            Added schematics in PDF form.
